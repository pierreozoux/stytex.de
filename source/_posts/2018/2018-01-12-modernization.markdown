## Hello 2018!

I had a long break since my [last article](/2017/03/26/kubernetes-private-cloud-deployments-comparison/). So it's time to say hello here and announce some little things.

## Blog modernization

I was thinking of migrating to [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/) for some while, but end up with staying on octopress. The main reason is that I actually don't want a big change on how my blog looks and feels. Especially I'm interested in all the paths, which are already deep inside Google's index.

The main feature is, that I learned there is a `<!-- more -->` separator, which makes my new index page doesn't look like a mile of full blog articles one after each other. A bit of coloring, a new [About Me](/about) page and some automation for my blog deploy process.

## Upcoming topics

Here is the roadmap of topics I'm going to cover in my upcoming articles.

* **Tutorial: Deploy HA Kubernetes cluster on bare-metal with Rancher** - the story of my 300$ Cluster with bunch of resources
* **JHipster + RabbitMQ + Kubernetes - How to use JHipster to stream data over RabbitMQ and operate deployments on Kubernetes**
* **Bitflow4J on Kubernetes: self-healing pipeline for Kubernetes clusters**

Feel free to suggest topics in the comments section :)
